# Facial Expression Recognition using FER2013 Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the multi-class facial expression recognition (FER) problem using the FER2013 dataset. The dataset includes significant class imbalance, especially with underrepresented classes such as *Disgust*, which impacts the model's performance negatively. To address this issue, the project explores different sampling strategies (undersampling, oversampling, hybrid sampling) and loss functions (Cross Entropy, Class Weighted, Focal Loss). Four deep learning models based on transfer learning (XceptionNet, MobileNetV3-Large-100, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-18) are trained and compared.

The best performing combination, XceptionNet with Cross Entropy Loss and hybrid sampling (target=8989), was enhanced by integrating face alignment using the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) architecture. This improved class-wise performance significantly. Final models were converted to ONNX format for real-time performance testing, achieving 66.76% accuracy and up to ~140 FPS.

## Explainable AI (LIME)
LIME was used to visualize which regions of the face the model focused on when making predictions. Observations included:
- Pre-alignment: Models often focused on irrelevant areas
- Post-alignment: More consistent focus on eyes, nose, and mouth

## Real-time Implementation
- **Input**: Webcam feed
- **Face Detection**: MTCNN
- **Preprocessing**: Face alignment and normalization
- **Inference**: ONNX model prediction with Softmax
- **Performance**: Real-time classification at high FPS with low latency
